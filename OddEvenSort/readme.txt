This is an implementation of odd even sort.

> Introduction

Odd even sort is a comparision based sorting algorithm which is based on bubble sort.It works by comparing odd–even and even–odd indexed pairings.
the time complexity of this algorithm is O(n^2).
it was developed by Nico Habermann in 1972 for working on parallel processors with local interconnections.
